# Project Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-07-13

## 1. Work Completed

We have successfully built and stabilized the core engine of the AI Trading Bot. The bot can now autonomously fetch data, analyze it with an AI model, and execute paper trades in a continuous loop. All foundational features are in place and tested.

- **Project Setup:**
    - Initialized a structured Python project with `app` and `tests` directories.
    - Created all necessary modules for handling configuration, data fetching, analysis, decision-making, trading, and state management.

- **Data Fetching and Indicator Calculation:**
    - Implemented `app/data_fetcher.py` to fetch real-time market data using `yfinance`.
    - Integrated `pandas-ta` to calculate a comprehensive set of over 15 technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.).

- **AI-Powered Signal Generation:**
    - Integrated the DeepSeek API in `app/analyzer.py` to generate trading signals (`buy`, `sell`, `hold`) based on the calculated indicators.
    - Developed robust error handling for API calls and response parsing.

- **"Think Twice" Decision Logic:**
    - Implemented a `thinker` module (`app/thinker.py`) to act as a decision-making layer.
    - This layer prevents executing duplicate consecutive signals and avoids trades when market volatility is below a configurable threshold (RSI change).

- **Trade Execution with Alpaca:**
    - Implemented the `AlpacaTrader` class in `app/trader.py` to connect to the Alpaca API.
    - The bot can successfully place market orders, check for existing positions, and retrieve account information.

- **Dynamic and Robust Trading Loop:**
    - The main loop in `app/main.py` connects all modules into a cohesive pipeline.
    - **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Trade quantity is now calculated as a percentage of the available cash, allowing the bot to adapt to the account size.
    - **Configurable Interval:** The trading interval is now configurable via `settings.TRADE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.
    - **State Management:** The bot saves its last executed signal and indicators to `state.json`, allowing it to be context-aware between runs.

- **Comprehensive Testing:**
    - Developed a full suite of unit tests using `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.
    - Tests cover all critical modules, including the data fetcher, analyzer, thinker, and trader, with mocks for all external API calls.

## 2. Current Stage

The project is at a stable checkpoint. The core backend engine is feature-complete and all existing unit tests are passing. The bot is capable of running autonomously and executing its trading strategy based on the defined logic.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate focus is to transition the project from a standalone script into a backend service that can be consumed by a frontend application.

1.  **Develop a REST API:** Expose the bot's functionalities through a FastAPI interface.
2.  **Create API Endpoints:** Build endpoints to get trading signals, view historical data, and see the bot's current state.
3.  **Refactor for Scalability:** Adapt the code to run as a scalable web service.
